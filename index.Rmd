# Preface {-}
 
This electronic book is a draft for testing out options for posting accessible data tables and reports for [CUNY's Office of Institutional Research](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/oira/institutional/).  

This site was created using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) using the default settings in the [Minimal Book Example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo), as a base and then customizing it to be more in line with CUNY's branding by altering the CSS.  

Data tables were created using the following R packages and functions: [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html), [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and a SUPER helpful function for writing *accessible* html tables that was written by [\@dcruvolo](https://community.rstudio.com/u/dcruvolo) and can be found on the RStudio Community post ['Create accessible HTML tables in RStudio?'](https://community.rstudio.com/t/re-create-accessible-html-tables-in-rstudio/47173).
